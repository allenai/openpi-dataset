How to Protect Cedar Shingles,www.wikihow.com/Protect-Cedar-Shingles,"Cedar shingles are a favorite material for roofs and walls because of their wide availability and ability to stay strong for many years. However, even cedar begins to break down after awhile, thanks to the loss of naturally occurring oils that protect the structure of the wood. Sunlight and moisture are the main culprits when it comes to cedar decay; organic debris, which encourages the growth of mold and mildew, can also lead to a decline in shingle quality.
