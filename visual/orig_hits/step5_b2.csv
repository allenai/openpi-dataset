How to Measure DC Offset,www.wikihow.com/Measure-DC-Offset,"DC offset (also known as DC bias) is a concept employed when dealing with electrical components, most notably audio equipment. These components send either power or audio signals using alternating current (AC), by which the signal reverses direction regularly. If the signal does not spend an equal amount of time traveling in both directions, however, the resulting imbalance is referred to as DC offset. A high level of DC offset can damage electrical components and degrade signal quality.
