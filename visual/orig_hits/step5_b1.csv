Goalies facing fast and hard slap-shots should double-cup. Either wear a banana cup underneath the goalie cup or purchase a goalie cup that features a ""double cup."",Boxers wear a cup that have a wide, padded waistband all the way around, to protect the kidneys. They are worn over or under shorts. However, better protection will be delivered to the groin wearing the cup under the shorts. Some manufacturers of ""no-foul"" boxing cups are now realizing that their boxing cup-protector must fit real tight against the body to provide 100% protection. A boxer should never go down in pain because his ""no-foul"" cup-protector didn't protect him adequately. Currently, it is likely that the big leather no-foul protectors are being re-designed to provide for a very tight fitting cup-protector which will completely eliminate the impact of a ""low blow"" to a boxer.,Some soccer and basketball players prefer to wear a ""soft"" cup, that is made of a pliable plastic. It's not as protective as a hard cup, but allows for some protection applicable to less-risk sporting games.
