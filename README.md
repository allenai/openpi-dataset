## Dataset

OpenPI Dataset files are available in JSON format under `openpi-dataset/data/gold/` . There are four files:
  - `id_question.jsonl`: each line is a json with an id, and the input sentence and its past sentences i.e., "x"
  - `id_question_metadata.jsonl`: the metadata corresponding to the question such as topic. Each line is a json with an id, and the metadata
  - `id_answers_metadata.jsonl`: each line is a json with an id, and the a list of answers i.e., "y"
  - `id_answers.jsonl`: the metadata corresponding to the answer. Each line is a json with an id, and the metadata (such as entity, attribute, before value, after value).


## Training 

You can modify the hyperparameters in this script to train the model.
```
sh scripts/training_bash.sh
```

## Run Prediction

To run predictions on a single file:
```
python src/model/generation.py \
      --model_path /path/to/trained_model \
      --test_input_file /path/to/input_file \
      --unformatted_outpath /path/to/store/unformatted_predictions \
      --formatted_outpath /path/to/store/formatted/predictions \
      --max_len max_len_say_200
```

To run predictions on multiple files, you can use this bash script:
```
sh scripts/predictions_bash.sh
```

## Run Evaluation

```
python eval/simple_eval.py 
    -g data/gold/test/id_answers.jsonl
    -p /path/to/formatted/predictions 
    --quiet
```
(no diagnostics file generated when using --quiet)

To run evaluation on multiple files, you can use this bash script:
```
sh scripts/evaluations_bash.sh
```
